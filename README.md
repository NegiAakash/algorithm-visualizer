# Algorithm visualizer

## Description

A react app made for visualizing various algorithms (mostly path finding algorithms). Right now only Dijkstra algorithm is available.

## Installation

- Clone the git repo. Put the below mentioned command in terminal.

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:NegiAakash/algorithm-visualizer.git
  ```

- Once the cloning is completed follow below mentioned steps.

  ```bash
  cd algorithm-visualizer
  npm install
  or
  yarn install
  ```

## Usage

- Once the installation is completed you can run the react app on localhost using

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

## TODO

- ~~Reset functionality for resetting the algorithm and grid.~~ âœ…
- Pause functionality.
- Speed controls for algorithm.
- Add other path finding algorithms.
- Improve the UI.
